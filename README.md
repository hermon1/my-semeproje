# Semester Project 2

## Goal

The assignment requires the student to build an e-commerce site with customer facing and admin sections. My main goal was to incorporate everything I learned up till this this point of Html, CSS, JavaScript to create the best possible site.

## Description

This is an old school vintage vinyl site for nostalgia purposes.

The homepage has a list of products with a search bar that filters. Clicking on the product takes the user to the to individual page where there are details but also reviews of the product. Its easy to add the product to the cart by clicking the "add to cart button".

I kept the theme simple and minimalistic with mostly a black and white theme. I wanted the user to flow naturally through the site without there being too many changes in the aesthetics.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- html
- javascript
- sass

## Hosting Services

www.one.com

## Installation and Setup

First clone down the project from github.

Then open the project and run `npm install` in the terminal.

Next you can run:

`npm start`

This will open a webbrowser and run the application in developer mode locally on your computer. Normally the application starts on `port 3000` if it is not already in use - press `Y` to open on another port. This page will reload when you save any changes. You can also see any errors in the terminal and console.
